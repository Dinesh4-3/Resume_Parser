# Resume_Parser
This project implements an intelligent Resume Parser that helps job seekers optimize their resumes by comparing them to job descriptions. The tool extracts key details from resumes and job descriptions, compares them for relevant skills, qualifications, and experience, and provides actionable feedback to improve resume alignment with the job role.
